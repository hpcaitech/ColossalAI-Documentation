However, distributed training systems often require manual parallelization plans, which can be complex and require expert knowledge in system engineering and configuration. This can be a challenge for most AI developers without the necessary skills. The need for manual parallelization can make deploying large-scale machine learning models difficult and expensive."},"Colossal-Auto/get_started/run_demo":{"id":"Colossal-Auto/get_started/run_demo","title":"Quick Demo","description":"Colossal-Auto simplifies the process of deploying large-scale machine learning models for AI developers. Compared to other solutions that require manual configuration of complex parallel policies and model modification, Colossal-Auto only requires one line of code from the user, along with cluster information and model configurations, to enable distributed training. Quick demos showing how to use Colossal-Auto are given below."},"concepts/colossalai_overview":{"id":"concepts/colossalai_overview","title":"Colossal-AI Overview","description":"Author: Shenggui Li, Siqi Mai"},"concepts/distributed_training":{"id":"concepts/distributed_training","title":"Distributed Training","description":"Author: Shenggui Li, Siqi Mai"},"concepts/paradigms_of_parallelism":{"id":"concepts/paradigms_of_parallelism","title":"Paradigms of Parallelism","description":"Author: Shenggui Li, Siqi Mai"},"features/1D_tensor_parallel":{"id":"features/1D_tensor_parallel","title":"1D Tensor Parallelism","description":"Author: Zhengda Bian, Yongbin Li"},"features/2D_tensor_parallel":{"id":"features/2D_tensor_parallel","title":"2D Tensor Parallelism","description":"Author: Zhengda Bian, Yongbin Li"},"features/2p5D_tensor_parallel":{"id":"features/2p5D_tensor_parallel","title":"2.5D Tensor Parallelism","description":"Author: Zhengda Bian, Yongbin Li"},"features/3D_tensor_parallel":{"id":"features/3D_tensor_parallel","title":"3D Tensor Parallelism","description":"Author: Zhengda Bian, Yongbin Li"},"features/gradient_accumulation":{"id":"features/gradient_accumulation","title":"Gradient Accumulation","description":"Author: Shenggui Li, Yongbin Li"},"features/gradient_clipping":{"id":"features/gradient_clipping","title":"Gradient Clipping","description":"Author: Boxiang Wang, Haichen Huang, Yongbin Li"},"features/gradient_handler":{"id":"features/gradient_handler","title":"Gradient Handler","description":"Author: Shenggui Li, Yongbin Li"},"features/mixed_precision_training":{"id":"features/mixed_precision_training","title":"Auto Mixed Precision Training","description":"Author: Chuanrui Wang, Shenggui Li, Yongbin Li"},"features/nvme_offload":{"id":"features/nvme_offload","title":"NVMe offload","description":"Author: Hongxin Liu"},"features/pipeline_parallel":{"id":"features/pipeline_parallel","title":"Pipeline Parallel","description":"Author: Guangyang Lu, Hongxin Liu, Yongbin Li"},"features/zero_with_chunk":{"id":"features/zero_with_chunk","title":"Zero Redundancy Optimizer with chunk-based memory management","description":"Author: Hongxiu Liu, Jiarui Fang, Zijian Ye"},"get_started/installation":{"id":"get_started/installation","title":"Setup","description":"Download From PyPI"},"get_started/reading_roadmap":{"id":"get_started/reading_roadmap","title":"Reading Roadmap","description":"Colossal-AI provides a collection of parallel training components for you.
